1. Arrays are represented as contiguous blocks of memory locations. 
Each element is stored sequentially, allowing direct access using its index. The address of an element is calculated as:

Address of array[i] = Base Address + (i * Element Size)

Advantages of Arrays:
    Constant-Time Access: Direct access to elements using indices (O(1) time complexity).
    Memory Efficiency: Low overhead due to contiguous storage.
    Cache Friendliness: Sequential storage improves cache performance.
    Simplicity: Easy to implement and use.
    Predictable Performance: Defined time complexity for operations.
