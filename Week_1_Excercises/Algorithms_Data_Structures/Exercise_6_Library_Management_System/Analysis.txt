1. Time Complexity:

    Linear Search: O(n) - Each element is checked until the target is found.
    Binary Search: O(log n) - The search interval is halved with each step.

2. When to Use:

    Linear Search: Suitable for small or unsorted datasets.
    Binary Search: Efficient for large, sorted datasets. Requires sorting beforehand if the data isn't already sorted.
