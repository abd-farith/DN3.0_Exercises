1. Efficient data structures and algorithms are crucial for handling large inventories because they directly impact the performance and scalability of the system. 
The right choice of data structures ensures quick access, insertion, deletion, and updating of inventory data, which is critical for maintaining real-time accuracy and 
efficiency in a warehouse management system.

2. The below datastructures are suitable for this problem

    1. ArrayList: Useful for maintaining a dynamic array that can grow as needed. 
    Suitable for scenarios where frequent random access is required.
    2. HashMap: Provides average O(1) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. 
    Ideal for handling large datasets with unique keys (e.g., product IDs).
