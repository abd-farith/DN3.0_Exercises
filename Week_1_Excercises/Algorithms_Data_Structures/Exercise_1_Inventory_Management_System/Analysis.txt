Time Complexity Analysis:

1. Add Product: The time complexity for adding a product using a HashMap is O(1) on average because it involves hashing the key and inserting the entry.
2. Update Product: The time complexity for updating a product is O(1) on average because it involves retrieving the entry by key and modifying its attributes.
3. Delete Product: The time complexity for deleting a product is O(1) on average because it involves hashing the key and removing the entry.

Optimization:

1. Using a HashMap already provides optimal average time complexity (O(1)) for add, update, and delete operations.
2. Ensuring that the HashMap has an adequate initial capacity and load factor can help maintain performance and reduce the need for resizing the internal data structures.
