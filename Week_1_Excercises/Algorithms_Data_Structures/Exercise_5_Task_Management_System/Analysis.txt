1. Time Complexity:

    Add: O(n) - Requires traversal to the end of the list.
    Search: O(n) - Requires traversal through the list.
    Traverse: O(n) - Requires visiting each node.
    Delete: O(n) - Requires traversal to find the node to delete.

2. Advantages of Linked Lists Over Arrays:

    Dynamic Size: Can grow and shrink dynamically without predefined size.
    Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Insertions and deletions at the beginning or middle are more efficient (O(1) for beginning insertions/deletions).
