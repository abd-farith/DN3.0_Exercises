1. Different types of Linked List

Singly Linked List:

    Structure: Each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.
    Advantages: Simple to implement, efficient insertions/deletions at the beginning.
    Disadvantages: Cannot traverse backwards, requires additional space for the next pointer.

Doubly Linked List:

    Structure: Each node contains data, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node.
    Advantages: Can traverse forwards and backwards, more flexible in insertion/deletion operations.
    Disadvantages: More complex to implement, requires extra memory for the previous pointer.
