1. Big O Notation and Its Importance:
    Big O notation is a mathematical representation used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time and space complexity. 
    It helps in analyzing the performance of algorithms as the input size grows, providing a high-level understanding of the algorithm's behavior without needing to delve into implementation details.

2. Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios for Search Operations:
    Best Case: The scenario where the search operation finds the target element immediately, usually at the first position. 
        For example, O(1) for linear search.
    Average Case: The scenario that represents the expected performance of the search operation, considering all possible positions of the target element. 
        For example, O(n/2) for linear search, which simplifies to O(n).
    Worst Case: The scenario where the search operation takes the maximum time, usually when the target element is not present, leading to a complete traversal of the data structure. 
        For example, O(n) for linear search.
